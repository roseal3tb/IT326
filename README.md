# project description
This project aims to analyze medical data to address the challenge of identifying patients at risk of heart disease. Using multiple clinical attributes, the project applies classification techniques to categorize patients into defined risk groups.

In addition, clustering methods are used to group patients with similar characteristics, helping to uncover hidden patterns and common patient profiles within the data. By combining these approaches, the project provides meaningful insights that support early detection and improve data-driven decision making in healthcare.
