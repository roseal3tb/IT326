# Heart disease 
# project description
This project aims to analyze medical data to address the challenge of identifying patients at risk of heart disease. Using multiple clinical attributes, the project applies classification techniques to categorize patients into defined risk groups.

In addition, clustering methods are used to group patients with similar characteristics, helping to uncover hidden patterns and common patient profiles within the data. By combining these approaches, the project provides meaningful insights that support early detection and improve data-driven decision making in healthcare.

# Motivation 

We chose this topic (predicting heart diseases) because it addresses a major health issue affecting many lives. By using classification techniques and clustering methods, we can enhance early diagnosis and provide effective preventive solutions. Analyzing multiple medical data points helps in accurately predicting the risk of heart diseases, assisting doctors in making quicker and more precise treatment decisions. This project aligns with modern trends in medicine and provides a practical application to improve healthcare. It also promotes the use of technology to offer innovative solutions in diagnosing and treating heart diseases.
